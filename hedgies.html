		<h1>A Little About Hedgehogs</h1>
			<p>A hedgehog is any of the spiny mammals of the subfamily <i class="taxonomy subfamily">Erinaceinae</i>, in the <i class="taxonomy order">Eulipotyphlan</i> family <i class="taxonomy family">Erinaceidae</i>. There are seventeen species of hedgehog in five genera, found through parts of Europe, Asia, and Africa, and in New Zealand by introduction. There are no hedgehogs native to Australia, and no living species native to the Americas (the extinct genus <i class="taxonomy genus">Amphechinus</i> was once present in North America). Hedgehogs share distant ancestry with shrews (family <i class="taxonomy family">Soricidae</i>), with gymnures possibly being the intermediate link, and have changed little over the last 15 million years. Like many of the first mammals, they have adapted to a nocturnal way of life. Hedgehogs' spiny protection resembles that of the unrelated porcupines, which are rodents, and echidnas, a type of monotreme. </p>
	
			<p>The name hedgehog came into use around the year 1450, derived from the Middle English <i>heyghoge</i>, from <i>heyg</i>, <i>hegge</i> ("hedge"), because it frequents hedgerows, and <i>hoge</i>, <i>hogge</i> ("hog"), from its piglike snout. Other names include urchin, hedgepig and furze-pig.</p>
			<p>The collective noun for a group of hedgehogs is <strong>array</strong>.</p>
